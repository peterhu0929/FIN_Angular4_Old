    // In our example we're treating any change in global state
    // as an example of user activity. So to start we need to
    //  just get an observable for the stream of state changes
    //
    let state$: Observable<IState> = store ;



    // Now here's where the power of RxJS comes into play. We're going to user
    // a technique where we react to state changes by mapping them to a new
    // observable that emits a value after the timeour period expires.
    //
    state$
    // We only want to start an activity timer when a user is actually logged
    //  in, so filter out any state changes where that flag is false.
    //
      .filter((x: IState) => x.loggedIn)
      //
      // Now we don't really care what the state change was in this context, and
      //  what we really want is an observable for our specific timeout value. So
      //  we map the state change to an observable that emits a single value after
      //  the timeout.
      //
      // Note, this also means that any state change we care about creates a *new*
      //  observable...and this is how we "reset" the timer when that happens.
      //
      .map((x: IState) => Observable.timer(115000))
      //
      // This is just for logging purposes in the demo so we can see when a new
      //  timer is started.
      //
      .do((x: any) => console.log('Activity detected! Timer has reset to 5 seconds'))
      //
      // Now here's the slick part (IMO). Each time a new "timeout" observable is
      //  created we want to make sure it replaces any timer we were subscribed to
      //  before. In other words, as soon as a new timer is started we want to use that
      //  one and just ignore anything we had before.
      //
      // In RxJS that's a simple operator called switch().
      //
      .switch()
      //
      // Finally, we need to subscribe to the timer observable to decide what to do
      //  should it actually fire (i.e., the timeout actually expired). Here we're
      //  just going to dispatch a new action that indicates the timeout expired. Then
      //  the reducer can decide what it actually means based on the state of the
      //  application at the time.
      //
      .subscribe((x: any) => {
        console.log('Inactivity interval expired! Dispatching timeout event')
        store.dispatch({type: ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_OCCURRED});
        this.router.navigate(['/login']);
